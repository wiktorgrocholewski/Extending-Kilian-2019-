\f0\fs24 \cf0 These are the codes and data we used for the part of the assignment regarding Heteroskedasticity as an Identification method. Inside there are 2 folders which were not created by us, i.e. \'93code\'94 which is the code used for Kilian (2023), and \'93Mbreak_matlab\'94 which is the code used by Qu and Perron (2007). The rest was taken largely from the labs and adjusted for our purposes. The csv file was exported from the figure 8a in the \'93code\'94 folder.\
